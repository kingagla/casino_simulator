There is hazard theory that assumes following:
1. Set fix value for bet.
2. If you loose, then bet again but doubled value.
3. Repeat 1. and 2. until you win. 
4. If you win, start from scratch. 

Some people consider this method as a one that should always work. I've created simulator of this method to check if it really can always work.
